        Hey there, I'm a Mobile Engineer hailing from the scenic landscapes of
        Kerala, where my journey at Neoito has unfolded over two exciting years.
        I'm not your typical developerâ€”I bring the magic of creativity to mobile
        and front-end development, crafting apps and web interfaces that not
        only work like a charm but look stunning too! I'm the go-to leader for
        my team, infusing a sense of adventure and fun into our projects. I
        thrive on innovation, finding new, exciting solutions to everyday
        challenges. Beyond work, I'm a passionate open-source contributor,
        making coding a joyful adventure for the global community.
